# Setting Up Your Environment

## Step 1: Create Your .env File

To configure environment-specific variables, first create your own `.env` file by copying the provided template:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

This will create a new `.env` file that you can safely edit without modifying the original template.

## Step 2: Configure Your Credentials

Open the newly created `.env` file in your editor. Replace all placeholder values with your actual credentials and base URL.

**Example:**

````bash
# Base URL of the site under test
BASE_URL=https://your-website.com


‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit your `.env` file** ‚Äî it is ignored via `.gitignore`.

## 3. Run Tests with UI (headed mode)

## 4. Open HTML Test Report

After running tests:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
